# comments/advices
1. I start by refactoring the gulpfile, in this way i continue to evolve the architecture
2. i make the choice of creating a public folder where my app will compiled
3. then i spread the different file family to keep a coherence and ease of proofreading:
    - assets (contain images and fonts )
    - controllers (to set my controllers)
    - libs (contain different middleware)
    - sass (to write styles with preprocessor)
    - route
    - config (all my data file)
    - view (where my view will be stocked)
4. i continu to use twig template to created page, but i don't finish it
5. Some advices i have is about :
    - namespace link (have to make similar link href on DOM for all page)
    - use more mixin or sass option
    - create shopping cart page
    - add more accessibility like html attribut (i have just verified the color)
    - add more comment on file to explain method
